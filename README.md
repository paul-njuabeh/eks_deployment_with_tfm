# eks_deployment_with_tfm is the code to provision an eks clutser in US-east-2 region with 2 node-groups.

# Now let's talk about the output content aut the end of the deployment. 

# The two blocks of code that you've provided are Kubernetes configuration files in YAML format, used to specify authentication rules and Kubernetes deployment details respectively.

# The first block is defining a Kubernetes ConfigMap called aws-auth. The aws-auth ConfigMap maps IAM roles to Kubernetes roles and provides a way for worker nodes in an Amazon EKS cluster to join the Kubernetes cluster. This ConfigMap will be created in the kube-system namespace and it has a key of mapRoles which contains a list that defines the IAM role to assume, the username of the worker node, and the groups that the node should belong to.

# The second block is defining a Kubernetes kubeconfig file. This kubeconfig specifies a single Kubernetes cluster and user, and provides connection details for using that user and cluster configuration. The certificate-authority-data value is the Base64-encoded PEM format certificate authority data that should be used to authenticate API requests to the Kubernetes cluster. The exec user specification provides authentication details for an executable to be run to obtain a bearer token, and this example is using the aws-iam-authenticator utility to obtain the token, which will be used for authentication with AWS. The aws user profile specifies an API server endpoint and a CA certificate authority file to use for clusters in the EKS Kubernetes service, along with a command string to use to obtain authentication credentials for the user.

# In summary, the first block of code will be used to ensure that worker nodes in an Amazon EKS cluster can join the Kubernetes cluster, while the second block provides authentication information for Kubernetes clients to connect to the Kubernetes API server using AWS credentials.
